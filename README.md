# Hi, I'm Jeff 👋

I like to build **smart utilities** and **automation tools** that solve specific, real-world friction points. From macOS system management to specialized productivity apps, I build things that make my life easier.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### 🚀 Available Now
* **[EasyDMG](https://github.com/jefe-johann/EasyDMG)** – Automate DMG installations on macOS. Set it as your default handler to mount, copy, and clean up app installs with zero clicks.
* **[Entrain](https://www.entrain.app)** – A Python generator that combines ElevenLabs text-to-speech with binaural beats for custom affirmations, meditation and sleep tracks.
* **[PIA-PanicGuard](https://github.com/jefe-johann/PIA-PanicGuard)** – A smart sleep management utility for macOS. It prevents Private Internet Access VPN from causing kernel panics by gracefully handling VPN connections, external drives, and apps before the system sleeps.
* **[Gmail Sweeper](https://github.com/jefe-johann/GmailSweeper)** – A Google Apps Script utility for automated Gmail cleanup based on custom filter configurations in Google Sheets. For instance, I get a lot of newsletters, special offers, etc. I don't want to immediately delete them, because I may want to read it. But, if I haven't gotten to it in a week, at that point it's just taking up space. This script lets you set different rules based on sender, keywords, etc, and have them auto-delete/archive after a certain amount of days. 
* **[Grab OTP](https://github.com/jefe-johann/grab-otp)** – A cross-browser extension that automatically retrieves and fills verification codes from your Gmail based on your active website. Have some upgrades to this coming soon, but it's usable.

### 🏗️ Coming Soon
These are mostly built, but haven't been brought to Github yet. Let me know if you're interested and I can put it higher on my priority list!
* **ShotCaller** – An AI-powered vision tool that analyzes your screenshots and automatically renames them with descriptive filenames (Python/Swift). Python will be available here, Swift on the App Store. Swift version includes a Finder Quick Action Extension to rename screenshots anywhere with a right click in Finder. 
* **YarrowLines** – A Flutter-based I Ching divination app that preserves traditional yarrow stalk mathematics and manual human interaction. Will be available on the App Store once I finish my "translation". Which could be a while.. 64 hexagrams, with multiple descriptions, 6 lines, and commentary for each. A labor of love ha. 
* **Rainstorm** - Generate rainstorms on your computer/phone. Sync with local weather, or just have intermittent rain throughout the day. Wash away your stress! Flutter app for all platforms.
* **FitFact** - Struggle with motivation to work out? Me too. This small app gives you daily reasons to exercise, with real peer reviewed studies on the many, many health benefits. Not motivational platitudes. That's what motivates me :)
* **PhotoRatr** - Community voting app to improve dating app photos. Sometimes, when you think you look good, you don't 😭
